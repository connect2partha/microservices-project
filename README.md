1. **Spring Cloud Config** provides server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With the Config Server, you have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments.
2. **Spring Cloud Gateway** aims to provide a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns to them such as: security, monitoring/metrics, and resiliency.
3. **Service Registry** is useful because it enables client-side load-balancing and decouples service providers from consumers without the need for DNS.
